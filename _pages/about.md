I am a Ph.D. student in Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University advised by Dr. Abhishek Halder (https://abhishekhalder.org/). Before joining Iowa State, I have completed my Master's in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering from Oklahoma State University. My research focuses on stochastic control, machine learning, rotorcraft aeromechanics, and eVTOL aircraft design.
